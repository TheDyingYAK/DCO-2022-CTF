## Important detail

> Our One Time Pad as a Service (OTPAAS) system offers perfect secrecy. Our keys were generated with a 100% cryptographically secure random number generator, and that is the only possible issue with cryptography so you're all good!
> 
> As a bounty we've provided the following ciphertext as an example of how secure this mechanism is.
